Quick operator to choose script to be executed from Folder path in preferences -> File Paths -> Script Directories (The first folder will be used for .py scripts lookup)

You can find operator by opening search menu (F3) and typing 'Run Script From Folder', you can also add it to quick menu (q), and give it a key shortcut

For now list of scripts is update only when you opening blender, so you if you want to add more scripts and refresh the list you need to re-open blender.

Feel free to contribute!
